          I'm a developer who enjoys using technology to solve practical issues
          and has an inquisitive mind. I have a strong desire to create
          solutions that are not only useful but also simple to use and
          pleasurable. I believe that careful design and strong engineering come
          together to create magic.

        <p className="mb-4">
          At UNSW, I'm presently pursuing a Master of Information Technology
          with an emphasis on software development, database systems, and
          cybersecurity. I work at PICA Group in addition to my studies, where I
          automate operations and streamline procedures to support digital
          transformation.

        <p className="mb-4">
          In my spare time, I'm usually walking, singing, playing the guitar,
          and taking pictures. These are the things that inspire my creativity
          and help me stay grounded.
